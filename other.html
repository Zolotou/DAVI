                    <p class="section__text">Git is a powerful, sophisticated system for distributed version control.
                        Gaining an understanding of its features opens to developers a new and liberating approach to
                        source code management. The surest path to mastering Git is to immerse oneself in its utilities
                        and operations, to experience it first-hand..


                        Basically: if you want work with a team in a project Git is a essential tool for you.

                                The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an
                                existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.
                                Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this
                                is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
                            </p>
                            <ol class="intro-ol">
                                <li> Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory,
                                    which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository. This
                                    metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. A HEAD file
                                    is also created which points to the currently checked out commit.</li>
                                <li> Aside from the .git directory, in the root directory of the project, an existing
                                    project remains unaltered (unlike SVN, Git doesn't require a .git subdirectory in
                                    every subdirectory)..</li>
                                <li> By default, git init will initialize the Git configuration to the .git subdirectory
                                    path. The subdirectory path can be modified and customized if you would like it to
                                    live elsewhere. You can set the $GIT_DIR environment variable to a custom path and
                                    git init will initialize the Git configuration files there. Additionally you can
                                    pass the --separate-git-dir argument for the same result. A common use case for a
                                    separate .git subdirectory is to keep your system configuration "dotfiles" (.bashrc,

                                Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never
                                change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, The
                                git add command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored
                                in a commit. These two commands git commit and git add are two of the most frequently
                                used.

                            <b> At a high-level, Git can be thought of as a timeline management utility.</b>
                            <p>
                                Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits can be
                                thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are
                                created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in
                                time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository. This is fundamentally
                                different from SVN, wherein the working copy is committed to the central repository. In
                                contrast, Git doesn’t force you to interact with the central repository until you’re
                                ready. Just as the staging area is a buffer between the working directory and the
                                project history, each developer’s local repository is a buffer between their
                                contributions and the central repository.
                            </p>

                                This changes the basic development model for Git users. Instead of making a change and
                                committing it directly to the central repo, Git developers have the opportunity to
                                accumulate commits in their local repo. This has many advantages over SVN-style
                                collaboration: it makes it easier to split up a feature into atomic commits, keep
                                related commits grouped together, and clean up local history before publishing it to the
                                central repository. It also lets developers work in an isolated environment, deferring
                                integration until they’re at a convenient point to merge with other users. While
                                isolation and deferred integration are individually beneficial, it is in a team's best
                                interest to integrate frequently and in small units. For more information regarding best
                                practices for Git team collaboration read how teams structure their Git workflow.

                                Links are the backbone of hypertext documents and allow you to navigate from one web
                                page to another. Their peculiarity is that the link itself can lead not only to HTML
                                files, but also to a file of any type, and this file can be placed on a completely
                                different site. The main thing is that the referenced document has access. In other
                                words, if the path to the file can be specified in the address bar of the browser, and
                                the file will be opened, then a link can be made to it.
                            </p>

                                To create a link, you must tell the browser what the link is, and also indicate the
                                address of the document to which the link should be made. Both actions are performed
                                using the a tag.

                                The href attribute defines a URL (Universal Resource Locator), in other words, the
                                address of the document to navigate to, and the contents of container a> are a link. The
                                text between the a> and / a> tags is blue and underlined by default.

                                attribute is typed with an error, then such a link is called broken. Broken links should
                                be strictly avoided as they mislead website visitors.

                                Naturally, such a message will differ in browsers, but the meaning remains the same -
                                the document to which the link leads cannot be opened. To avoid such errors, test all
                                links for their performance and immediately eliminate the existing errors.

                                A linked file opens in a browser window only if the browser knows the type of document.
                                However, since the link can be made to any type of file, the browser cannot always
                                display the document. This displays a message on how to process the file - open it or

                                An anchor is a bookmark with a unique name at a specific place on a web page, designed
                                to create a link to it. It is convenient to use anchors in large documents so that you
                                can quickly jump to the desired section.
                            </p>

                                To create an anchor, you must first make a bookmark in the appropriate place and give it
                                a name using the name attribute of the a> tag
                            </p>

                                One feature of the browser is associated with anchors. After moving to the specified
                                anchor, pressing the "Back" button returns not to the previous viewed page, but to the
                                link from which the transition to the anchor was made. It turns out that to go to the
                                previous document, you need to press the "Back" button two times.
                            </p>

                                The link can also be made to a bookmark located on another web page or even another
                                site. To do this, in the href attribute of the a> tag, you must specify the address of
                                the document and at the end add the hash symbol # and the bookmark name
                            </p>

                                Validation will mean checking a document for compliance with web standards and
                                identifying existing errors. Accordingly, a web document that has gone through a similar
                                procedure and has no comments on the code is valid. The code of a web page must obey
                                certain rules called a specification, which is developed by the W3 Consortium
                                (www.w3c.org) with the support of the browser developers.

                                At first glance, it seems that validation is necessary, because we are talking about
                                reducing the number of developers' mistakes and writing "correct" code. In fact,
                                everything is much more complicated, and around validation there is still heated debate
                                about its relevance. In order to objectively reveal this issue, we will further consider
                                the pros and cons of such a check.

                                Although HTML code has a fairly simple hierarchical structure, it is easy to get
                                confused in the code as the size of the document grows, therefore, it is easy to make a
                                mistake. Browsers, despite obviously incorrect code, will try to render the web page
                                anyway. But since there is no single regulation on how a "crooked" document should be
                                displayed, each browser tries to do it differently. And this, in turn, leads to the fact
                                that the same document may look different in popular browsers. Correction of obvious
                                mistakes and systematization of the code leads, as a rule, to a stable result.

                                standards are starting to fade into the past. Each new version of the browser
                                increasingly supports specifications and displays documents with minimal or no errors.
                                Developers of sites that also adhere to the canons of web standards, thus comply with
                                modern trends in the development of web technologies.

                                facto standard for storing data and exchanging information between different
                                applications. XML syntax is stricter than HTML and does not forgive the slightest
                                mistakes. In a sense, XML is like programming languages in which the program won't
                                compile until the code is debugged. HTML is the first step to learning XML, so by
                                accustoming yourself to write code according to all the rules, it will be easier to move
                                to the next stage of HTML development.

                                and become visible when a certain critical mass is reached. In particular, the amount of
                                code becomes smaller, more compact, and more readable. Accordingly, the loading speed of

                                Sites, of course, are made so that people visit them. It is the visitors who are the
                                measure of the site's work, and they are interested in information and the way to obtain
                                it. The user wants the site to display correctly in his favorite browser, load quickly
                                and contain the materials he needs. Note that there is nothing in this list about the
                                document code and its validity, visitors are simply not interested. Therefore, a
                                completely invalid site, but made with soul, filled with interesting materials will
                                attract more visitors than an empty resource, but made according to all the "rules".

                                Browser developers do not always follow the specification and in some cases interpret
                                the code not according to the given rules, but in their own way. Ultimately, this leads
                                to the fact that a web page that is displayed correctly (that is, as intended by the
                                developers) in one browser is displayed with errors in another. Following the
                                specification in such cases is likely to scare off some browser users. For example,
                                Internet Explorer (IE) currently holds the leading position among browsers, but it
                                supports the HTML and CSS specification worse than Firefox and Opera. Obviously, IE
                                users, when visiting a site made according to all standards, but not taking into account

                                Site customers, as well as their developers, do not like this situation, so when faced
                                with a choice: standards or a browser, they mostly choose a browser.
                            </p>
                            It turns out a disappointing picture - there is no particular need to spend time debugging
                            the code to comply with the specification. It is better to devote this time to making the
                            document work without problems in different browsers - this is how web developers mostly
                            think.

                            So is it worth validating documents and doing this step when writing web pages? Definitely
                            yes. It will help someone to identify the existing shortcomings, to others it will help to
                            write correct code. Fixing errors, achieving full compliance with standards, or leaving them
                            for the sake of compatibility with different browsers - here everyone decides for himself
                            what goals he pursues and what is more important for him.

                        hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for
                        version control and collaboration.


                        GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.
                        Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command
